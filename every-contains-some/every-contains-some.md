## _.every(), _.contains(), _.some()

Implement the following underscore methods (recreate the functions from scratch!)

- [http://underscorejs.org/#every](every)
- [http://underscorejs.org/#contains](contains)
- [http://underscorejs.org/#some](some)

_Hint: **Predicate** functions are functions that return a boolean (`true` or `false`)_

This Kata is a chance to test things we have covered so far in the course!
Please git commit after every unit test and TDD it all the way.
Treat this exercise as you would a technical test from a top tech company!
